## 🧰 Components Required

* ICL8038 Function Generator IC
* Resistors
* Capacitors
* Potentiometers (for frequency and amplitude control)
* Breadboard / PCB
* Connecting Wires
* Power Supply (±5V to ±12V or single supply setup)

## ⚙️ How It Works

The ICL8038 operates by using a **constant current charging and discharging method** to generate a triangular waveform. This waveform is internally shaped to produce a sine wave, while a comparator generates a square wave output. All three waveforms are available simultaneously at different output pins.

## 📐 Output Waveforms

* **Sine Wave** — Smooth periodic waveform for analog signal testing
* **Square Wave** — Used for digital signal and clock testing
* **Triangle Wave** — Useful for modulation and waveform analysis
